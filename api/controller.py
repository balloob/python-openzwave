class ZWaveController(ZWaveObject):
    '''
    The controller manager.

    Allows to retrieve informations about the library, statistics, ...
    Also used to send commands to the controller

    Commands :

        - Driver::ControllerCommand_AddController - Add a new secondary controller to the Z-Wave network.
        - Driver::ControllerCommand_AddDevice - Add a new device (but not a controller) to the Z-Wave network.
        - Driver::ControllerCommand_CreateNewPrimary (Not yet implemented)
        - Driver::ControllerCommand_ReceiveConfiguration -
        - Driver::ControllerCommand_RemoveController - remove a controller from the Z-Wave network.
        - Driver::ControllerCommand_RemoveDevice - remove a device (but not a controller) from the Z-Wave network.
        - Driver::ControllerCommand_RemoveFailedNode - move a node to the controller's list of failed nodes.  The node must actually
        have failed or have been disabled since the command will fail if it responds.  A node must be in the controller's failed nodes list
        for ControllerCommand_ReplaceFailedNode to work.
        - Driver::ControllerCommand_HasNodeFailed - Check whether a node is in the controller's failed nodes list.
        - Driver::ControllerCommand_ReplaceFailedNode - replace a failed device with another. If the node is not in
        the controller's failed nodes list, or the node responds, this command will fail.
        - Driver:: ControllerCommand_TransferPrimaryRole    (Not yet implemented) - Add a new controller to the network and
        make it the primary.  The existing primary will become a secondary controller.
        - Driver::ControllerCommand_RequestNetworkUpdate - Update the controller with network information from the SUC/SIS.
        - Driver::ControllerCommand_RequestNodeNeighborUpdate - Get a node to rebuild its neighbour list.  This method also does ControllerCommand_RequestNodeNeighbors afterwards.
        - Driver::ControllerCommand_AssignReturnRoute - Assign a network return route to a device.
        - Driver::ControllerCommand_DeleteAllReturnRoutes - Delete all network return routes from a device.
        - Driver::ControllerCommand_CreateButton - Create a handheld button id.
        - Driver::ControllerCommand_DeleteButton - Delete a handheld button id.

    Callbacks :

        - Driver::ControllerState_Waiting, the controller is waiting for a user action.  A notice should be displayed
        to the user at this point, telling them what to do next.
        For the add, remove, replace and transfer primary role commands, the user needs to be told to press the
        inclusion button on the device that  is going to be added or removed.  For ControllerCommand_ReceiveConfiguration,
        they must set their other controller to send its data, and for ControllerCommand_CreateNewPrimary, set the other
        controller to learn new data.
        - Driver::ControllerState_InProgress - the controller is in the process of adding or removing the chosen node.  It is now too late to cancel the command.
        - Driver::ControllerState_Complete - the controller has finished adding or removing the node, and the command is complete.
        - Driver::ControllerState_Failed - will be sent if the command fails for any reason.
