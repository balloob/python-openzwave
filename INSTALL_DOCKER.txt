Docker installation instructions
--------------------------------

Setting up a development environment is as easy as running:

  docker build -t python-openzwave .

This will build the image 'python-openzwave' with the right dependencies installed for building and installing Python Open Z-Wave.

To enter the development environment, run the following command:
(Replace /dev/ttyUSB0 with the path to your Z-Wave USB stick.)

  docker run \
    --device=/dev/ttyUSB0:/zwaveusbstick:rwm \
    -v `pwd`:/usr/src/app \
    -t -i python-openzwave

This will open a shell in a linux environment. You are now ready to develop!

To build and install for Python 2, run:

  ./compile.sh
  ./install.sh

To build and install for Python 3, run:

  ./compile.sh --python3
  ./install.sh --python3

Enjoy!
